# Named Entity Recognition  

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to extract **named entities** from `.docx` files using [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) (Stanford NLP Toolkit). This guide shows how to load a Word document, analyze it with a pretrained NLP (Natural Language Processing) model, and export the results to `.txt` files.

This method supports **over 70 languages**, but we focus specifically on **Ukrainian** and **Russian** as example languages. No prior programming knowledge is required to follow. All necessary code and instructions are provided inside the notebook.
